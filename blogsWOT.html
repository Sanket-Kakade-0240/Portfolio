    <h1>What is wall of thoughts?</h1>
    <p>It is a place where I jot down and believe life learning quotes as well as lessons. 
    It is inspired by the concept of 'hall of fame'.
    It consists of my life experience and the lessons I learned from them.
    My main purpose of this is to make myself sure that I get reminded by them everday and incorporate the change in myself.
